%*****************************************************************************80
%
%% MAIN is the main program for FEM1D.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    FEM1D solves a one dimensional ODE using the finite element method.
%
%    The differential equation has the form:
%
%      -d/dx ( p(x) du/dx ) + q(x) * u = f(x)
%
%    The finite-element method uses piecewise linear basis functions.
%
%    Here U is an unknown scalar function of X defined on the
%    interval [XL,XR], and P, Q and F are given functions of X.
%
%    The values of U or U' at XL and XR are also specified.
%
%    The interval [XL,XR] is "meshed" with NSUB+1 points,
%
%    XN(0) = XL, XN(1)=XL+H, XN(2)=XL+2*H, ..., XN(NSUB)=XR.
%
%    This creates NSUB subintervals, with interval number 1
%    having endpoints XN(0) and XN(1), and so on up to interval
%    NSUB, which has endpoints XN(NSUB-1) and XN(NSUB).

%
%  Parameters:
%
%    real ADIAG(NU).
%    ADIAG(I) is the "diagonal" coefficient of the I-th
%    equation in the linear system.  That is, ADIAG(I) is
%    the coefficient of the I-th unknown in the I-th equation.
%
%    real ALEFT(NU).
%    ALEFT(I) is the "left hand" coefficient of the I-th
%    equation in the linear system.  That is, ALEFT(I) is the
%    coefficient of the (I-1)-th unknown in the I-th equation.
%    There is no value in ALEFT(1), since the first equation
%    does not refer to a "0-th" unknown.
%
%    real ARITE(NU).
%    ARITE(I) is the "right hand" coefficient of the I-th
%    equation in the linear system.  ARITE(I) is the coefficient
%    of the (I+1)-th unknown in the I-th equation.  There is
%    no value in ARITE(NU) because the NU-th equation does not
%    refer to an "NU+1"-th unknown.
%
%    real F(NU).
%    ASSEMBLE stores into F the right hand side of the linear
%    equations.
%    SOLVE replaces those values of F by the solution of the
%    linear equations.
%
%    real H(N), the length of the subintervals.  
%
%    integer IBC. declares what the boundary conditions are.
%    1, at the left endpoint, U has the value UL,
%       at the right endpoint, U' has the value UR.
%    2, at the left endpoint, U' has the value UL,
%       at the right endpoint, U has the value UR.
%    3, at the left endpoint, U has the value UL,
%       and at the right endpoint, U has the value UR.
%    4, at the left endpoint, U' has the value UL,
%       at the right endpoint U' has the value UR.
%
%    integer INDX(1:N+1).
%    For a node I, INDX(I) is the index of the unknown
%    associated with node I.
%    If INDX(I) is equal to -1, then no unknown is associated
%    with the node, because a boundary condition fixing the
%    value of U has been applied at the node instead.
%    Unknowns are numbered beginning with 1.
%    If IBC is 2 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
%    at node 0, which will be unknown number 1.  Otherwise,
%    unknown number 1 will be associated with node 1.
%    If IBC is 1 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
%    at node N, which will be unknown N or N+1,
%    depending on whether there was an unknown at node 0.
%
%    integer NL, the number of basis functions used in a single
%    subinterval.  (NL-1) is the degree of the polynomials
%    used.  For this code, NL is fixed at 2, meaning that
%    piecewise linear functions are used as the basis.
%
%    integer NODE(NL,N).
%    For each subinterval I:
%    NODE(1,I) is the number of the left node, and
%    NODE(2,I) is the number of the right node.
%
%    integer NQUAD.
%    The number of quadrature points used in a subinterval.
%    This code uses NQUAD = 1.
%
%    integer NSUB, the number of subintervals into which the interval
%    [XL,XR] is broken.
%
%    integer NU, the number of unknowns in the linear system.
%    Depending on the value of IBC, there will be N-1,
%    N, or N+1 unknown values, which are the coefficients
%    of basis functions.
%
%    real UL.
%    If IBC is 1 or 3, UL is the value that U is required
%    to have at X = XL.
%    If IBC is 2 or 4, UL is the value that U' is required
%    to have at X = XL.
%
%    real UR.
%    If IBC is 2 or 3, UR is the value that U is required
%    to have at X = XR.
%    If IBC is 1 or 4, UR is the value that U' is required
%    to have at X = XR.
%
%    real XL, the left endpoint of the interval over which the
%    differential equation is being solved.
%
%    real XN(1:N+1).
%    XN(I) is the location of the I-th node.  XN(1) is XL,
%    and XN(N+1) is XR.
%
%    real XQUAD(N)
%    XQUAD(I) is the location of the single quadrature point
%    in interval I.
%
%    real XR, the right endpoint of the interval over which the
%    differential equation is being solved.

%% ASSEMBLE assembles the matrix and right hand side of the linear system.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    Note that a 1 point quadrature rule, which is sometimes used to
%    assemble the matrix and right hand side, is just barely accurate
%    enough for simple problems.  If you want better results, you
%    should use a quadrature rule that is more accurate.

%
%  Parameters:
%
%    Input, real F(NU), the solution of the linear equations.
%
%    Input, integer IBC.
%    IBC declares what the boundary conditions are.
%    1, at the left endpoint, U has the value UL,
%       at the right endpoint, U' has the value UR.
%    2, at the left endpoint, U' has the value UL,
%       at the right endpoint, U has the value UR.
%    3, at the left endpoint, U has the value UL,
%       and at the right endpoint, U has the value UR.
%    4, at the left endpoint, U' has the value UL,
%       at the right endpoint U' has the value UR.
%
%    Input, integer INDX(1:N+1).
%    For a node I, INDX(I) is the index of the unknown
%    associated with node I.
%    If INDX(I) is equal to -1, then no unknown is associated
%    with the node, because a boundary condition fixing the
%    value of U has been applied at the node instead.
%    Unknowns are numbered beginning with 1.
%    If IBC is 2 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
%    at node 0, which will be unknown number 1.  Otherwise,
%    unknown number 1 will be associated with node 1.
%    If IBC is 1 or 4, then there is an unknown value of U
%    at node N, which will be unknown N or N+1,
%    depending on whether there was an unknown at node 0.
%
%    integer NSUB.
%    The number of subintervals into which the interval
%    [XL,XR] is broken.
%
%    Input, integer NU.
%    NU is the number of unknowns in the linear system.
%    Depending on the value of IBC, there will be N-1,
%    N, or N+1 unknown values, which are the coefficients
%    of basis functions.
%
%    Input, real UL.
%    If IBC is 1 or 3, UL is the value that U is required
%    to have at X = XL.
%    If IBC is 2 or 4, UL is the value that U' is required
%    to have at X = XL.
%
%    Input, real UR.
%    If IBC is 2 or 3, UR is the value that U is required
%    to have at X = XR.
%    If IBC is 1 or 4, UR is the value that U' is required
%    to have at X = XR.
%
%    Input, real XN(1:N+1).
%    XN(I) is the location of the I-th node.  XN(1) is XL,
%    and XN(N+1) is XR.
