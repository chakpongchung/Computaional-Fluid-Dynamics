%% FEM1D_BVP_LINEAR solves a two point boundary value problem.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The program uses the finite element method, with piecewise linear basis
%    functions to solve a boundary value problem in one dimension.
%
%    The problem is defined on the region 0 <= x <= 1.
%
%    The following differential equation is imposed between 0 and 1:
%
%      - d/dx a(x) du/dx + c(x) * u(x) = f(x)
%
%    where a(x), c(x), and f(x) are given functions.
%
%    At the boundaries, the following conditions are applied:
%
%      u(0.0) = 0.0
%      u(1.0) = 0.0
%
%    A set of N equally spaced nodes is defined on this
%    interval, with 0 = X(1) < X(2) < ... < X(N) = 1.0.
%
%    At each node I, we associate a piecewise linear basis function V(I,X),
%    which is 0 at all nodes except node I.  This implies that V(I,X) is
%    everywhere 0 except that
%
%    for X(I-1) <= X <= X(I):
%
%      V(I,X) = ( X - X(I-1) ) / ( X(I) - X(I-1) ) 
%
%    for X(I) <= X <= X(I+1):
%
%      V(I,X) = ( X(I+1) - X ) / ( X(I+1) - X(I) )
%
%    We now assume that the solution U(X) can be written as a linear
%    sum of these basis functions:
%
%      U(X) = sum ( 1 <= J <= N ) U(J) * V(J,X)
%
%    where U(X) on the left is the function of X, but on the right,
%    is meant to indicate the coefficients of the basis functions.
%
%    To determine the coefficient U(J), we multiply the original
%    differential equation by the basis function V(J,X), and use
%    integration by parts, to arrive at the I-th finite element equation:
%
%        Integral A(X) * U'(X) * V'(I,X) + C(X) * U(X) * V(I,X) dx 
%      = Integral F(X) * V(I,X) dx
%
%    We note that the functions U(X) and U'(X) can be replaced by
%    the finite element form involving the linear sum of basis functions,
%    but we also note that the resulting integrand will only be nonzero
%    for terms where J = I - 1, I, or I + 1.
%
%    By writing this equation for basis functions I = 2 through N - 1,
%    and using the boundary conditions, we have N linear equations
%    for the N unknown coefficients U(1) through U(N), which can
%    be easily solved.
